*   **OmniVoid**: Rewrote C++ class into destructive black-hole simulator (Hawking radiation, spaghettification). Rebuilt `OmniVoidWatcher` UI.
*   **OmniMultiverse**: Implemented `OmniUniverseManager` allowing spawning, tracking, and incursions of parallel universes. Rebuilt `OmniMultiverseExplorer` UI.
*   **OmniNano**: Rewrote C++ classes to act as 3D STM simulation with collision/thermal physics. Rebuilt `OmniNanoFactory` UI.
*   **OmniMind (BCI)**: Rebuilt C++ classes as 20Hz neural simulator (EEG bands, time-domain signal, intention detection). Rebuilt `OmniMind` UI.
*   **OmniOmega**: Overhauled C++ to act as system-wide IPC bus and global variable registry. Rebuilt `OmniOmega` UI as "Nexus Core".
*   **OmniPortal**: Rewrote C++ logic as 10Hz wormhole simulation (energy draw, stability decay, MALP probes). Rebuilt `OmniPortalExplorer` UI.
*   **OmniSpirit**: Overhauled C++ as metaphysical simulation (Resonance, Veil Thickness, entity manifestation). Rebuilt `OmniSpiritGuide` UI.
*   **OmniCreator**: Overhauled `OmniCompiler` in C++ as fully simulated multi-threaded AST build engine. Rebuilt `OmniCreatorStudio` UI as IDE Terminal Console.
*   **OmniHardware**: Built 20Hz 40-pin GPIO simulator (voltage, PWM, floating logic). Rewrote `OmniHardware` UI.
*   **OmniSynth**: Built 30Hz DSP Wavetable audio engine. Rewrote `OmniSynth` UI.
*   **OmniDash**: Built 1Hz system diagnostic engine utilizing QSysInfo. Rewrote `OmniDash` UI.
*   **OmniScribe**: Built ECMAScript 7 engine wrapping QJSEngine. Rewrote `OmniScribe` UI.
*   **OmniStudio**: Built custom C++ painted item for infinite spatial logic node routing. Rewrote `OmniStudio` UI.

## [v42.0.0] - The OmniNexus Integration Phase
*   **OmniSimulationEngine (Master Clock)**: Overhauled the C++ physics/simulation clock to act as a global signal dispatcher (`globalTick(dt)`). Modules like `OmniPhysicsWorld`, `OmniKernel`, and `OmniGenesis` have abandoned their isolated internal QTimers to bind directly to this global clock. Altering the `tickRate` or `timeDilation` in the engine now globally affects the speed of orbital mechanics, hardware PWM, quantum algorithms, and AGI growth simultaneously.
*   **OmniNexus Unified Bridge**: Created a new massive Desktop Environment application (`OmniUI/apps/OmniNexus`). It successfully links against all 30 sub-modules simultaneously via CMake. The UI features a 3x2 Grid Layout combining telemetry from the System Kernel, AGI Singularity Core, and Multiverse Array into a single Command Bridge window.
*   **Cross-Module IPC (OmniOmega)**: Utilized `OmniUniversalContext` to bind event triggers across physically separate modules. For instance, a manual `KERNEL_PANIC` broadcast from the UI now triggers the C++ backend to forcefully halt `OmniAGI` processing and drops the universal `timeDilation` to 0.1x to slow down physics for "debugging". If the `OmniUniverse` module detects physics are broken (e.g. Fine Structure Constant altered too much), it broadcasts an event that forces the `OmniMultiverse` module to initiate a reality incursion, collapsing the `OmniGenesis` engine into a Big Crunch.
