/*
 * Implementation details:
 *
 * Normally, a call from atomic_notify_one() or atomic_notify_all() corresponds
 * to a call to cond.notify_one() or cond.notify_all(). This simple
 * implementation would require that we keep a distinct wait condition variable
 * per atomic variable, of which there could be an arbitrary number.
 *
 * Instead, we have a limited set of std::condition_variable, which are
 * selected based on the address of the variable being waited/notified on.
 * Because multiple, distinct variables could be sharing the same condition
 * variable, we need to perform a cond.notify_all() call in case the lock is
 * contended by waiters to more than one address, as we can't be sure which one
 * would be woken up by the cond.notify_one() call.
 *
 * We recover some of the performance of notifying a single waker by also
 * storing the address of the variable that was being waited on. If it matches
 * the address of the variable being notified, we can perform a notify_one()
 * call. This also allows us to avoid any system call in case no waiter has yet
 * joined the queue. In case of contention, we store a sentinel address
 * instead, indicating there are waiters to multiple variables. The last waiter
 * to leave a wait queue is responsible for resetting the watched address back
 * to nullptr.
 *
 * Performance details:
 *
 * This implementation is designed for systems where neither the Standard
 * Library's own std::atomic_wait nor operating system futexes are available
 * (read: usually, not the systems BobUI is used most frequently on). Therefore,
 * it's designed for simplicity, not performance. Simplifications applied
 * include:
 * - the total number of possible condition variables
 * - the hashing algorithm to select a condition variable (simple XOR)
 * - no attempt to wait for a variable change before calling cond.wait()
 *   (no spinning, no HW-assisted wait)
 *
 * Other limitations:
 *
 * We only support 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-bit variables and we require bit-exact
 * comparisons for all bits. This means we do not support objects with padding
 * bits or without unique representations.
