    \title Concurrent Filter and Filter-Reduce
    \brief Selecting values from a sequence and combining them, all in parallel.
    \ingroup thread

    The BobUIConcurrent::filter(), BobUIConcurrent::filtered() and
    BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced() functions filter items in a sequence such
    as a QList in parallel. BobUIConcurrent::filter() modifies a
    sequence in-place, BobUIConcurrent::filtered() returns a new sequence
    containing the filtered content, and BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced()
    returns a single result.

    These functions are part of the \l {BobUI Concurrent} framework.

    Each of the above functions have a blocking variant that returns the final
    result instead of a QFuture. You use them in the same way as the
    asynchronous variants.

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 6

    Note that the result types above are not QFuture objects, but real result
    types (in this case, QStringList and QSet<QString>).

    \section1 Optimize includes

    compilation times and binary sizes. To use the
    \l {BobUIConcurrent::filter}{BobUIConcurrent::filter()},
    \l {BobUIConcurrent::filtered}{BobUIConcurrent::filtered()}, and
    \l {BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced}{BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced()}
    functions, you can include a more specific header:

    \code
    #include <BobUIConcurrentFilter>
    \endcode

    \section1 Concurrent Filter

    BobUIConcurrent::filtered() takes an input sequence and a filter function.
    This filter function is then called for each item in the sequence, and a
    new sequence containing the filtered values is returned.

    The filter function must be of the form:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 0

    T must match the type stored in the sequence. The function returns \c true if
    the item should be kept, false if it should be discarded.

    This example shows how to keep strings that are all lower-case from a
    QStringList:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 1

    The results of the filter are made available through QFuture. See the
    QFuture and QFutureWatcher documentation for more information on how to
    use QFuture in your applications.

    If you want to modify a sequence in-place, use BobUIConcurrent::filter():

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 2

    Since the sequence is modified in place, BobUIConcurrent::filter() does not
    return any results via QFuture. However, you can still use QFuture and
    QFutureWatcher to monitor the status of the filter.

    \section2 Concurrent Filtered and Continuations

    The result of BobUIConcurrent::filtered() call is a QFuture that contains
    multiple results. When attaching a \c {.then()} continuation to such
    QFuture, make sure to use a continuation that takes QFuture as a parameter,
    otherwise only the first result will be processed:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 18

    In this example \c {badFuture} will only print a single result, while
    \c {goodFuture} will print all results.

    \section1 Concurrent Filter-Reduce

    BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced() is similar to BobUIConcurrent::filtered(),
    but instead of returning a sequence with the filtered results, the results
    are combined into a single value using a reduce function.

    The reduce function must be of the form:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 3

    T is the type of the final result, U is the type of items being filtered.
    Note that the return value and return type of the reduce function are not
    used.

    Call BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced() like this:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 4

    The reduce function will be called once for each result kept by the filter
    function, and should merge the \e{intermediate} into the \e{result}
    variable. BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced() guarantees that only one thread
    will call reduce at a time, so using a mutex to lock the result variable
    is not necessary. The BobUIConcurrent::ReduceOptions enum provides a way to
    control the order in which the reduction is done.

    \section1 Additional API Features

    \section2 Using Iterators instead of Sequence

    Each of the above functions has a variant that takes an iterator range
    instead of a sequence. You use them in the same way as the sequence
    variants:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 5


    \section2 Using Member Functions

    BobUIConcurrent::filter(), BobUIConcurrent::filtered(), and
    BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced() accept pointers to member functions.
    The member function class type must match the type stored in the sequence:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 7

    Note the use of qOverload. It is needed to resolve the ambiguity for the
    methods, that have multiple overloads.

    Also note that when using BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced(), you can mix the use of
    normal and member functions freely:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 8

    \section2 Using Function Objects

    BobUIConcurrent::filter(), BobUIConcurrent::filtered(), and
    BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced() accept function objects
    for the filter function. These function objects can be used to
    add state to a function call:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 13

    Function objects are also supported for the reduce function:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 14

    \section2 Using Lambda Expressions

    BobUIConcurrent::filter(), BobUIConcurrent::filtered(), and
    BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced() accept lambda expressions for the filter and
    reduce function:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 15

    When using BobUIConcurrent::filteredReduced() or
    BobUIConcurrent::blockingFilteredReduced(), you can mix the use of normal
    functions, member functions and lambda expressions freely.

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 16

    You can also pass a lambda as a reduce object:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 17

    \section2 Wrapping Functions that Take Multiple Arguments

    If you want to use a filter function takes more than one argument, you can
    use a lambda function or \c std::bind() to transform it onto a function that
    takes one argument.

    As an example, we use QString::contains():

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 9

    QString::contains() takes 2 arguments (including the "this" pointer) and
    can't be used with BobUIConcurrent::filtered() directly, because
    BobUIConcurrent::filtered() expects a function that takes one argument. To
    use QString::contains() with BobUIConcurrent::filtered() we have to provide a
    value for the \e regexp argument:

    \snippet code/src_concurrent_bobuiconcurrentfilter.cpp 12
